+ If you want to turn on logging—as in, you keep making errors, like what's
  happening to me now—you can use `i3-with-shmlog` instead of the regular
  `i3` desktop file. I found this out on the ArchWiki[^thanks]; the *official*
  i3 documentation did not update this at all—that should be updated soon.
